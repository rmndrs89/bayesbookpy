But what are then probabilities?\n\nThere are roughly three different frameworks to define probabilities: the **classical** framework, the **frequentist** framework, and the **Bayesian** framework.\n\nIn general, a probability, under any of these frameworks, is just a way of assigning numbers to a set of mutually exclusive possibilities. The numbers, called \"_probabilities_\", just need to satisfy three properties [@Kolmogorov2018ProbTheory]:\n\n1. A probability value must be non-negative (i.e., greater than or equal to zero).\n2. The sum of the probabilities across all events in the sample space must be 1.0\n3. For any two mutually exclusive events, the probability that one or the other occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities.\n\nUnder the classical framework, outcomes that are equally likely have equal probabilities. For example, when rolling a fair die, there are six possible outcomes, and they're all equally likely, thus the probability of rolling a four is just $\\mbox{Pr}(X = 4) = \\frac{1}{6}$. \n\nUnder the frequentist framework, probabilities are regarded to as long-run relative frequencies.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-rolling-dice .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nN = 4_000  # number of rolls\nxs = np.random.choice(a=6, size=N, replace=True, p=np.ones(6)/6)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(\n    np.arange(1, N + 1),\n    [np.mean(xs[:roll] == 3) for roll in np.arange(1, N + 1)]\n)\nax.axhline(1./6, c=\"gray\", ls=\"-.\", label=f\"1/6\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"Number of rolls\")\nax.set_ylabel(f\"Pr($X$=4)\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The long-run relative frequency of rolling a 4 with a fair six-sided die.](01_02_basics_of_probability_files/figure-html/fig-rolling-dice-output-1.png){#fig-rolling-dice}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Random variables\nSuppose that $X$ represents some unknown quantity of interest. If the value of $X$ is unknown, or could change, we call it a **random variable**. The set of possible values, denoted $\\mathcal{X}$, is called the **sample space**. An **event** is a set of outcomes from a given sample space [@Murphy2022Introduction].\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Example: random variables\n\nIf $X$ represents the face of a dice that is rolled, i.e., $\\mathcal{X} = \\left\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 6 \\right\\}$, the event of \"_seeing a 1_\" is denoted $X = 1$, the event of \"_seeing an odd number_\" is $X \\in \\left\\{1, 3, 5 \\right\\}$.\n:::\n\n### Events\nThe expression $\\mbox{Pr}(A)$ is used to denote the probability with which you believe an event $A$ is true. If an event will definitely happen, we write $\\mbox{Pr}(A)=1$ and if an event is definitely not happening we write $\\mbox{Pr}(A)=0$. Furthermore, the probability of $A$ not happening is denoted $\\mbox{Pr}(\\bar{A}) = 1 - \\mbox{Pr}(A)$.\n\n",
